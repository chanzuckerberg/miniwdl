"""
Plugin for uploading output files to S3 "progressively," meaning to upload each task's output files
immediately upon task completion, instead of waiting for the whole workflow to finish. (The latter
technique, which doesn't need a plugin at all, is illustrated in ../upload_output_files.sh)

To enable, install this plugin (`pip3 install .` & confirm listed by `miniwdl --version`) and set
the environment variable MINIWDL__S3_PROGRESSIVE_UPLOAD__URI_PREFIX to a S3 URI prefix under which
to store the output files (e.g. "s3://my_bucket/workflow123_outputs"). The prefix should be set
uniquely for each run, to prevent different runs from overwriting each others' outputs.

Shells out to the AWS CLI, which must be pre-configured so that "aws s3 cp ..." into the specified
bucket works (without explicit auth-related arguments).

Deposits into each successful task/workflow run directory and S3 folder, an additional file
outputs.s3.json which copies outputs.json replacing local file paths with the uploaded S3 URIs.
(The JSON printed to miniwdl standard output keeps local paths.)

Limitations:
1) All task output files are uploaded, even ones that aren't top-level workflow outputs. (We can't,
   at the moment of task completion, necessarily predict which files the calling workflow will
   finally output.)
2) Doesn't upload (or rewrite outputs JSON for) workflow output files that weren't generated by a
   task, e.g. outputting an input file, or a file generated by write_lines() etc. in the workflow.
   (We could handle such stragglers by uploading them at workflow completion; it just hasn't been
   needed yet.)
