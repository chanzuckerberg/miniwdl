# Default configuration for miniwdl runner, organized into sections & options within each section.

# 2. environment variables MINIWDL__SECTION__KEY (uppercased with double-underscores)
# 3. custom configuration file (mutually exclusive):
#    a) file named on command-line --cfg
#    b) file named by environment variable MINIWDL_CFG
#    c) miniwdl.cfg in XDG_CONFIG_HOME & XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
# 4. WDL/runtime/config_templates/default.cfg
