[scheduler]
# Size of thread pools for task and subworkflow call management. Bounds how many WDL tasks the
# runner may attempt to schedule concurrently; actual concurrency may be less due to CPU/memory
# resource availability. This setting may need to be increased on multi-node deployments, but not
# beyond ~200 (guideline) to avoid excessive overhead in miniwdl's Python process.
# 0 = default to host `nproc`.
# -@
call_concurrency = 0
# call_concurrency applies to URI download tasks too, however, it may be desirable to limit their
# concurrency further still, since they're exceptionally I/O-intensive. In that case set
# download_concurrency to a nonzero value lower than the effective call_concurrency.
# (New in v1.3.1)
download_concurrency = 0

# When one task fails, immediately terminate all other running tasks. If disabled, stop launching
# new tasks, but leave those still running to succeed or fail on their own. The latter mode might
# be useful with call caching (see below) to avoid discarding all work done by other tasks.
fail_fast = true


[docker_swarm]
# Docker Swarm Mode is the default container backend. It's included with every docker installation,
# but disabled by default. The following option allows miniwdl to automatically initialize the local
# host as a one-node swarm if needed, by performing
#     docker swarm init --listen-addr 127.0.0.1 --advertise-addr 127.0.0.1
# This is is typically helpful for single-node use, but should be disabled if a preexisting swarm
# is to be used.
auto_init = true
# Period for polling the status of running containers. Increasing this reduces steady-state load on
# miniwdl and dockerd (when many tasks are running concurrently), but also increases the delay
# noticing when tasks have exited and (--verbose) the appearance of standard error logs. Worker
# threads randomize the interval +/- 50% to spread out activity.

[file_io]
# During startup, require the run directory and input files to reside somewhere within this root
# directory. This constraint is needed in cluster deployments relying on a shared mount. It can
# also be useful on a single node to prevent accidental consumption of a small boot/home volume,
# by confining workflow operations to some spacious scratch/data mount.

# Each succeeded run directory has an "out/" folder containing (by default) a symbolic link to each
# output file in its original working location. If output_hardlinks is true, then out/ is populated
# with hardlinks instead of symlinks. Beware the potential confusion arising from files with
# multiple hardlinks! See also delete_work, below.
output_hardlinks = false
# Delete task working directory upon completion. The task container's working directory is a
# bind-mounted host directory, so files written into it are left behind after the container is torn
# down. If tasks write large non-output files into their working directory (instead of $TMPDIR as
# they should), then it can be useful to delete them automatically.
# Values:
#   false   = never delete (default)
#   success = delete working directories of succeeded tasks
#   failure =            "                  failed tasks
#   always  =            "                  both succeeded and failed tasks
