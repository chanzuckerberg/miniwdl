# miniwdl/tools_image

This subdirectory is the recipe for a Docker image bundling tools that miniwdl uses to provide certain functionality (without requiring end-users to install extra OS packages). End-users shouldn't deal with this image; it's used internally by miniwdl and does *not* include miniwdl itself.

For example, the image bundles [aria2c](https://aria2.github.io/), which miniwdl uses to download large input files supplied as URLs. Miniwdl synthesizes a WDL task with this image, which inputs the URL and outputs the desired file.

This image doesn't change often, so we build it manually. First, authenticate your local `docker` CLI to GitHub Container Registry ([instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/pushing-and-pulling-docker-images#authenticating-to-github-container-registry)) using a Personal Access Token *with SSO enabled* for the `chanzuckerberg` organization. Then,

```
docker build --no-cache -t miniwdl_tools:latest tools_image/
TAG=$(docker inspect miniwdl_tools:latest | jq -r .[0].Id | tr ':' '_' \
      | xargs printf 'ghcr.io/chanzuckerberg/miniwdl_tools:Id_%s')
docker tag miniwdl_tools:latest $TAG
docker push $TAG
echo $TAG
```

This tags the image based on its content-digest "Image ID" to help pulling the exact intended image. (The Image ID is *not* the "Repo Digest", which is another way of achieving that.)

Lastly, update references to this image in [default.cfg](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/miniwdl/blob/main/WDL/runtime/config_templates/default.cfg).
